git status


 Now you need to take the local Git repository and put it into a remote, 
 centrally-located repository so others can collaborate on the project. 
 By storing the project code into a central, remote repository, 
 other collaborators can copy the code to their system for modification.

To CREATE REMOTE REPO
In github, create local repo
in gitbash, create directory and cd into ; then add a read me file
  git init
  git remote add origin URL_repo ( configure local repo into remote repo)
  git remote -v (to verify the originâ€™s URL matches the remote repository.)
  git branch -M main (force rename the local branch to main )
  
  git push -u origin main ( push our local repository to the remote GitHub repository)
  git pull origin main (pull down the contents of the GitHub remote repository to my local system)
