open a linux server (VM)  with docker install; docker ps; docker ps -a
go to Dockerhub; splunk/splunk; docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=abc123@#$" --name splunk splunk/splunk:latest
docker ps; ifconfig; IP_VM:8000
docker exec -it ID_cont bash; id
In splunk server -> search & reporting -> search server -> give time -> to get intelligent info from the data
-> add data -> upload file -> access.log, secure.log, error.log  -> start searching
Tool use to analyse data ; to monitor; to create alert; create report. generate report: error in the last 24h
{ someone use the root account to login to the server, splunk should send alert 
=> maybe we can block that server or shut down the ssh while we investigating who is using the root user to login)
 
 
 k8s monitor the pods, if pods go down another one come out. but k8s can't monitor the app running inside the pods.
 then we need Prometheus to monitor the app. prometheus use grafana for visualization
 when we say k8s cluster, we talk about microservice 
 (way for company to break an app into small pieces (login page, contact page, video page ...) and run each piece as a service in k8s cluster)
