Pro week 22
There is a python app  with AI capability that will be used to analyse the data stored in bigQuery
problem: afeter each developer change, we need a docker image stored in GCR
Application: github => cloud build => docker images in GCR => deploy to GKE. 
App is not runnning or consumed 24/7 , it is needed just whenwe have a prototype demo,
need on demand solution for the gke cluster so we can deploy the app during demo

for my knowledge the best solution is terraform
why? we can create , destroy, and recreate
how did i do?
i did some research 
download some module from the google cloud community terraform project
modify it to fit our environnment or reality
test
deliver
